      "previous yearb^@^Ys NHIS data. A limitation of the MEPS is\n",
      "that the samples sizes overlap for two years due to the\n",
      "survey panel design. This means that there is a much\n",
      "smaller sample size in comparison to other surveys. For\n",

      "whereas the MEPS had only 30,716 respondents.2,8\n",
      "Although the MEPS collects information on a wide\n",
